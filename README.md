# Intelligent waste segregation system
This project demonstrates waste detection using a YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. It identifies recyclable, non-recyclable, and hazardous waste items in a webcam stream.

# Fearures
 AI-Powered Waste Classification using YOLOv8.

 Real-Time Object Detection via webcam.

 Three Waste Categories:

    -> Recyclable: Items that can be processed and reused.
  
    -> Non-Recyclable: General waste that cannot be reused.
  
    -> Hazardous: Requires special disposal methods.
